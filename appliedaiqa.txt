Our Story
How We Got Here

Back in 2015 we saw a need for a new kind of technology group. One that was specifically focused on an emerging technology at the time called the "Internet of Things" ( IoT ).

We went to work forming our non-profit, and setting our sites on building a unique community that was a bridge between makers, entrepreneurs and engineers with those of investors and executives. The result was the largest IoT community in the United States, IoT Fuse. We hosted conferences, monthly meetups and hackathons that served thousands of people in Minnesota and beyond.

On January 1st, 2020, we took the organization to the next level and began focusing on all emerging technologies and rebranded ourselves as Emerging Technology North.

"Go Big or Go Home" is what we believe in and are thrilled that you are interested in what we have to offer! We will be continuing to serve those of all ages in the community who are interested in plugging into those who are working in the exciting field of Emerging Technologies.
